              <h2>Beretta 92FS</h2>
              <h4>The World's Most Trusted Military and Police Pistol</h4>
              <p>The Beretta 92FS has been setting the standards for best military, police and tactical pistol for over a quarter century.</p>
              <p>The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semiauto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.</p>
              <h4>Superior Reliability</h4>
              <p>The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds.</p>
